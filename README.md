# KAKTAKOMB

this plugin allows you to encrypt and decrypt buffers using a password that you can define via an option
or using the propmt versions of `encrypt-buffer` and `decrypt-buffer`.

## NOTE!

for some reason this work with relatively small buffers, it must be something
with me not understanding quite well how openssl works, so if you know better
I would appreciate if you make a pr or open an issue to help us improve this
plugin. :)
